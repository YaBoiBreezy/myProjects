In my first CS course in high school, I learned C++. The prof said last year someone tried and failed
to make a 3D maze. So I tried too, and succeeded. I no longer have the code, but I made a quick
mockup using python. This is identical, except different maze, 
only 1 maze (in the original I used a 4D array of many mazes),
and up/down is q/e not space and shift. Enjoy!
