tic tac toe neural network, written in python, kaggle
created entire game, random, minimax, user-input and neral network players
neural network trained with evolutionary algorithm, completely made by me
used general knowledge from internet, but every line was mine
hence the lack of fancy things like matrix multiplication and least squares equations
didn't turn out perfect, but it plays pretty well
