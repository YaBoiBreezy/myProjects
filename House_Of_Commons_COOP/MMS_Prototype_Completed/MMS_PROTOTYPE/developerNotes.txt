hello, if you are reading this hopefully you are taking this prototype and making it into a full website!
most of the website is filler, the left column is legit just a picture lol, the video player is good though
you can take it out pretty easily, the html and css are all in big chunks, 
<div id="videoPlayer">, the relevant bits from Colours.css, both of vidTouch.css and vidClick.css
grab most of the assets and all the js, link them up in the HTML <head> and end of body (order matters sadly, repeat what's in the HTML)
making it play M3U8 was tough, required node_modules for video.js and sub-libraries so grab those plugins too
or you can download them by reading the console log errors to see what's missing and doing npm in console

It takes 6 .M3U8 URL's for the stream languages/cc's, add them at the top of logic.js

the video player has 2 streams, 1 video 1 audio, playing concurrently. To avoid desync they both play, pause, setPosition, speed and reload together
I also have code at the very bottom to prevent drift desync maunally. They still desync sometimes, mostly because the stream currentTime values get messed up

the volume slider disappears if you drag it out further then the bar itself and release. It's something to do with the functions being called on the 3 volume 
elements in a bad order, but honestly it's not necessarily even a problem because after you set the volume once, you're done

download and share icons do nothing, they seem to be supposed to clip the video or something, 
really complicated UI and backend, and not part of the prototype requirements. See old ParlVu for more info

(+/-) changes video speed and greys out the speed options. Also displays current speed in top corner like old VHS
audio only mode stops video playback (not me, some plugin does it automatically, no complaints here)
it also makes quality and cc's grey AND unselectable AND unclickable (mouse doesn't change, clicking does nothing)
toggling audioOnly mode is the best way to refresh the streams to fix audio desync, if necessary
I used "subs" and "captions" interchangeably, I know there's a difference but I kinda don't care, and there's only one type (CC's)
the "s" and "d" keys do nothing, you could maybe hook them up to download and share?
the c key toggles captionson/off, same language as audio, if audio is floor opens the captions popup menu to let you pick

the big ParlVu logo top right links to the old site, hopefully that's helpful
I included the calendar and filter png's from the sidebar, I don't use them but you might

I commented out node_modules->video.js->dist->video.js->ln 65215 because it was filling the console with warnings, couldn't fix, not really broken
the other warnings are for pausing video when it's loading, accessing video length when it's loading (seekTimeUpdate gets called every 0.025 seconds to update the 
video bar progress and stuff based on video length, if the video hasn't loaded yet it puts an error for length. The errors don't break anything, so I ignore it)

quote from online, maybe important:
Unlike a native HLS implementation, the HLS tech has to comply with the browser's security policies. That means that all the files that make up the stream must be 
served from the same domain as the page hosting the video player or from a server that has appropriate CORS headers configured. Easy instructions are available for 
popular webservers and most CDNs should have no trouble turning CORS on for your account.
