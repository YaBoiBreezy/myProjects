Frontend of gentle forced alignment project

In terms of the video player, I used video.js
all the functionality is custom code, written in logic,js before the first //==============================
download and share icons do nothing

I commented out node_modules->video.js->dist->video.js->ln 65215 because it was filling the console with warnings, couldn't fix, not really broken
the other warnings are for pausing video when it's loading, accessing video length when it's loading (seekTimeUpdate gets called every 0.025 seconds to update the 
video bar progress and stuff based on video length, if the video hasn't loaded yet it puts an error for length. The errors don't break anything, so I ignore it)

to prevent audio skipping I wait for vidPlayer.readyState==4, that means the video player is ready to go
seekTimeUpdate gets called a lot, it handles real-time constant things like progress bar and time text
syncTime keeps the audio and video players synced up, really cool little custom function I came up with myself
The drag/resize stuff is to make the lightbox moveable/resizeable

If the audio plays but the video is blank, you may have mixed up audio and video links
video: blah-<language (en,fr,fl)>-blah.mp4/m3u8
audio:  blah-blah-<language (EN,FR,FL).mp4/.m3u8

the things to generate the lists of options are at the bottom of logic.js

If the audio is offset, change audioOffset for the given stream. So far all offsets have been whole negative numbers around 10  (-9,-10,-12)

In the lists (options, streams, occurences), instead of storing data separately I store it in the elements themselves. This is a bad way to do it
options are the list of black text, streams are green buttons, occurences are blue rectangles
options contain their text, streams contain their stream number (index in data) and the search term, occurences contain their stream number and start time
