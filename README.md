# myProjects
repository of all my stuff, mostly school work

Note: all my C/C++ stuff is lost in either high school computers or my pc's virtual box, which got deleted when my pc got corrupted. Summaries of all that code:

High school C++: (windows)
a bunch of games, including a couple text adventures, real-time maze thing with enemies/keys, basic 2D maze, thing where a stickman blocks incoming projectiles using WASD to move a shield, and a 3D maze which I remade real quick in python (look in the 3D_maze folder)
Also made merge sort with linked lists, some circular includes and object inheritance and recursive solutions projects, and other stuff I don't remember...

University C code: (linux)
Made a bunch of general data handlers using structs, including arraylists and linked lists. Made projects using threads and ports, to simulate things racing up a mountain while enemies came down. Final project was importing data from a file, storing it, sorting it, and displaying reports. All code was separated into .h and .c files, and had a ReadMe.txt.

University C++ code: (linux)
A lot of proper object-oriented code with storage, input-output, control and action object types, oop diagrams, etc. Used advanced data handlers like custom maps, custom object operators (if(hare<apple)), dynamic memory allocation and deallocation.
