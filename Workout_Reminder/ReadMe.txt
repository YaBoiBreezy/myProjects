Python script I wrote to make a popup window every 30 min on the hour/halfhour telling me to do an exercise

I have a few preset, on windows startup it autoruns (you have to set that up ofc, put it or a shortcut in the windows autorun folder)

It picks a random one, pops up, then moves it to done. You can see what's done and what's left to do

If the assignment is planking, it will wait 10 seconds, beep, wait x seconds, beep, wait x+2 seconds, beep. This way you know how long to go for
