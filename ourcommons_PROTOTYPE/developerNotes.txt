hello, if you are reading this hopefully you are taking this prototype and making it into a full website!

download and share icons do nothing, they seem to be supposed to clip the video or something, 
really complicated UI and backend, and not part of the prototype requirements. See old ParlVu for more info

I commented out node_modules->video.js->dist->video.js->ln 65215 because it was filling the console with warnings, couldn't fix, not really broken
the other warnings are for pausing video when it's loading, accessing video length when it's loading (seekTimeUpdate gets called every 0.025 seconds to update the 
video bar progress and stuff based on video length, if the video hasn't loaded yet it puts an error for length. The errors don't break anything, so I ignore it)

to prevent audio skipping I wait for vidPlayer.readyState==4, that means the video player is ready to go
Firefox is really stupid, doesn't load full scroll3a.png, so I reload it every 0.3 seconds in logic.js. May be a "myPC" issue, remove it when you remove scrollBig.png
Firefox also needed special key listeners for +,-
seekTimeUpdate gets called a lot, it handles real-time constant things like progress bar and time text
The audio for the links I used is ahead 10 seconds, hence audioOffset. Set it to 0 at the top of logic.js to remove it
sizeVideo() is for swapping between lightbox and minibox, minToggle is for minimising it (-). It's complicated, mostly because it makes lots of UI changes
A lot of stuff relies on the 4 extra .css files, I only use one at a time and that handles most of the visual settings. There is some js DOM manipulation, but not much
syncTime keeps the audio and video players synced up, really cool little custom function I came up with myself
The drag/resize stuff is to make the lightbox moveable/resizeable
