#tester for game mechanic:
#spend some coins to get an amulet, which gives you 3 attributes of random values 1-10  (ex. health, damage, speed)
#possible to have one better/== another in all 3 attributes, in which case weaker one is obsolete, but also possible to have many that are good (1,1,10) vs (10,10,2)
#so how many can you have total, if you remove any obsolete ones?
#1000 possible amulets, check all with recursion

Result:
    after 2.5 days of simulating, 1-6 indeed returned as 27, validating my predicted pattern.
I believe that 1-10 would take over a million years to run, at current rates, so I am forced to be satisfied with this, that is the conclusion that the answer is 1-10=75
